### Project Title
Udacity Bikeshare Data Project - Python with Pandas and NumPy Libraries

### Description
Udacity Project with the goal of using bikeshare data to explore coding with Python, and using Pandas and NumPy libraries for data analysis.

The project consisted of downloading the data files and starting .py file from Udacity.  Then I installed Python 3, NumPy and pandas using Anaconda.  From there through trial and error, Udacity lessons, and online google searches I completed the bikeshare.py code and tested it to work and correctly analyze bikeshare data.

The csv files contained data from bikeshare riders including the time they started and ended trips, the start and end locations, whether subscribers or not, and in some cases additional user data such as gender and birth year.

The final program asks users for which city's data they wish to review, then they can sort by month or day of the week if preferred.  Then they are given a series of data points, including most popular times to start trips, most popular starting or ending locations, multiple data points around total use or average use of a bike, and user information where available.
